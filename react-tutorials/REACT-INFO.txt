In React JS

useState:
"useState" is used to store information/data from the server. It automatically refreshes the page when
the data is changed. It is also used to make a component dynamic.

ex: account number and number of signatures associated with it, can be stored in useState. Similarly 
when a new signature is added it will be added in setState function.



createContext/useContext:
"createContext" is used to pass information in between react components like "information is passed 
between parent and child or neibouring components". 

ex: createContext is used with either "constant value" or "useState" to store information. 
"useContext" keyword is used to access the information in children components where the 
information should displayed.
